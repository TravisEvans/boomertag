Ethan's (pussyfart123) v1.0.0-alpha perspective
good:
"pretty good"
feels flowwy, potential in fluidity
says "watch ghostrunner gameplay no death run"
bad:
crouch speed way too slow (known bug)
sprint way too fast (maybe try sprint/ supersprint)
jumping momentum is confusing, somewhat clunky and slow
add wallrunning, sliding
comments:
look at other games for level design.
for an alpha, pretty commendable.
again, look at ghostrunner- "https://youtu.be/3_ZXa14odts?t=2760"


josh as of alpha 0.1.2

make the falling less floaty
likes the movement
idk
