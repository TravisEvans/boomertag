boomer shooter tag

so far there are many an idea for this, here is a quick dotpoint jumble

## Base mechanics
- Equipment and Ordinance: you can have a grenade that affects how you or others move, and an equipment that affect how you interact
- Tag. duh. knock a mf down and kingmake that bitch
- Parry mechanic. Nothin feels better than to say "nuh-uh" to someone trying to shoot you with something.
### Other ideas
- Equipment idea: Grappling hook. pros, long range tagging, cons, has to travel and can be parried to knock you down, also doesnt knock down on tag
- Equipment idea: pane of glass. one defence hit but will slow
- Equipment idea: anchor. liek a tron bike but heavy
- Equipment idea: rocket launcher
- Equipment idea: auto crossbow
- Equipment idea: blunderbuss duh
- Equipment idea: some kind of hitscan funny gun
- Equipment idea: fishing rod! swing!
- Ordinance idea: water baloon that removes all friction like on ice
- Ordinance idea: no grav nade
- Ordinance idea: xtreeeeme grav nade
- Ordinance idea: just a fucking grenade

## Planned development order

~~First things first, I want to make a world that isnt complete dogshit to look at.~~ Map making is not easy, so temporarily fixed.
With a movement controller organised, and multiplayer functioning, there needs to be a tag mechanic, as in the main mechanic of the game. This seems somewhat pointless without a simple character model to animate. ~~Therefore, the next major task is to create a character, or find one for a bandaid fix~~ This was easy, rigging is not, gotta learn to animate it.

## Current issues
- stairs are an impossible KZ challenge
- can not for the life of me get a simple pixel effect working on main viewport
- theres no actual character models
- no permission for current map usage (ahem, aboobies)
- momentum feels off
- UI is trash, and broken
- there's no obvious control scheme?
- ground is shiny
- stairs are fucked

## Things to be added
- Wall run? Maybe? I think so
- equipment
- ordinance
- think mario cart 50, 100, 150cc, for diff speeds in diff games
- game settings per round of the game
- most other shit
- maps fr fr

## Development areas
- Tilemap development: Creation of assets for tilemaps.
> Not being done
- Sprite and asset development: the game needs sprites, characters, colours and shit
> Not being done
- Programming and scripting
> chabis doing this
- learning blendr, laigter, and krita
> also being done, chab (not really, probably next on the list)
