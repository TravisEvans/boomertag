boomer shooter tag

so far there are many an idea for this, here is a quick dotpoint jumble

## BASE MECHANICS
- Equipment and Ordinance: you can have a grenade that affects how you or others move, and an equipment that affect how you interact
- Tag. duh. knock a mf down and kingmake that bitch
- Parry mechanic. Nothin feels better than to say "nuh-uh" to someone trying to shoot you with something.
### Other ideas
- Equipment idea: Grappling hook. pros, long range tagging, cons, has to travel and can be parried to knock you down, also doesnt knock down on tag
- Equipment idea: pane of glass. one defence hit but will slow
- Equipment idea: anchor. liek a tron bike but heavy
- Equipment idea: rocket launcher
- Equipment idea: auto crossbow
- Equipment idea: blunderbuss duh
- Equipment idea: some kind of hitscan funny gun
- Ordinance idea: water baloon that removes all friction like on ice
- Ordinance idea: no grav nade
- Ordinance idea: xtreeeeme grav nade
- Ordinance idea: just a fucking grenade
