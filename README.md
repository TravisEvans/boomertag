boomer shooter tag

so far there are many an idea for this, here is a quick dotpoint jumble

## Base mechanics
- Equipment and Ordinance: you can have a grenade that affects how you or others move, and an equipment that affect how you interact
- Tag. duh. knock a mf down and kingmake that bitch
- Parry mechanic. Nothin feels better than to say "nuh-uh" to someone trying to shoot you with something.
### Other ideas
- Equipment idea: Grappling hook. pros, long range tagging, cons, has to travel and can be parried to knock you down, also doesnt knock down on tag
- Equipment idea: pane of glass. one defence hit but will slow
- Equipment idea: anchor. liek a tron bike but heavy
- Equipment idea: rocket launcher
- Equipment idea: auto crossbow
- Equipment idea: blunderbuss duh
- Equipment idea: some kind of hitscan funny gun
- Ordinance idea: water baloon that removes all friction like on ice
- Ordinance idea: no grav nade
- Ordinance idea: xtreeeeme grav nade
- Ordinance idea: just a fucking grenade

## Planned development order

First things first, I want to make a world that isnt complete dogshit to look at. I will get some ideas from LegionGames YT tutorials to learn better the map making within godot
Post that, I would like to make a gun, to better understand the mechanics involved with raytracing and colliding with objects.

## Current issues
- You will hit your head when uncrouching
- stairs are an impossible KZ challenge
- Generation of TrenchBroom maps are somewhat complex and best kept VERY simple.
> TrenchBroom maps also need textures, lest they are pure white with 600 surfaces

## Things to be added
- Slide
- Wall run? Maybe? I think so
- ???????

## Development areas
- Tilemap development: Creation of assets for tilemaps.
> Not being done
- Sprite and asset development: the game needs sprites, characters, colours and shit
> Not being done
- Programming and scripting
> Not being done
- Fucking around in godot
> SOOO being done - chab, and evan
- learning blendr, laigter, and krita
> also being done, chab
- I think learning TrenchBroom would be a great idea for mechanic garden prototyping
> Not being done
